         <h3>The Explorer</h3>
          <p> I am a 15 year old boy with big dreams.I have Life is full of exploration. Fifteen years in my life, I have been surrounded with various people, environments, and cultures. These elements have important impact on my personalities, physical health, career choices, and many personal aspects. Sometimes I look back with nostalgia, but I gain new understandings of myself after the nostalgia. Just like T.S. Eliot describes life in his poem, “We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time” </p>

          <h2>BIG DREAM</h2>
           <h4>Bring Revolution</h4> 
           <p> I am very much ambitious about In a time of fear, rebellion and possible revolution, drastic actions must be taken to ensure the stability and safety of a country. Therefore the authorities were justified in their actions, as drastic as they may have been. Order and stability is the most important element in a country & combination of great leadership & moral code it is nothing but revolution which is inevitable  </p>
